I have created some interesting programs, mostly working with natural language processing, numerical solving and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation\">procedural generation</a>, but never really dabbled with graphics or user interface.

Students who have worked with me have passed international exams, done internships in Europe and in the USA, and taken postgrad courses at top universities, improving also their cultural adaptation and their professional profiles.

Foxes are known for their astuteness, so I found that suitable for a project whose audience is language learners (and, somehow, also web development learners ðŸ˜‰). In spite of its beauty, the fox is an untamed animal, which mirrors the elusiveness of the human quest for wisdom (ok, I just made that up)."
